6) Launch Dijkstra Visualization on your IDE. Depending on your IDE you may get some configuration options. Press yes to all of them. 


## Graph Generation

The data sets are not randomized. Optimized random graph generation needs to be worked on, and the graph generation folder
only captures a slight portion of the work done.
